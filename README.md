# Trending Titles

## Description

Welcome to Trending Titles! This website was a collaborative effort between my colleagues Mustafa Ahmed, Logan Benjamin, and myself. As our first group project, we set out to create a website that allows the user to select from a list of genres, then display 5 movie recommendations based off of their choice. In order to create this website, we employed the use of various frameworks and API's that we were previously unfamiliar with. This included the use of tailwind css with jQuery and Unpkg for the framework, Fontawesome for some extra styling and elements, as well as Themoviedb API + API Ninja to bring dynamic functionality to the page. The following is an image of what one could expect to see upon opening the page:

## Usage

Upon opening the page, the user will be greeted with the header, which contains a blue "Start Now" button. After the button is pressed, the website will automatically scroll to a section which contains 3 simple steps on how to use the website, as well as a list of all 16 available genres to choose from. Next, the user simply needs to select a genre and click the second, "Find Movies", button. This will present the user with a list of 5 movie recommendations based off the genre selected. Below the user will also see a random Chuck Norris quote, as well as a footer with links to 'Github', 'Contact', and a surprise YouTube video. The following is an image of what one could expect to see upon viewing their selection:
